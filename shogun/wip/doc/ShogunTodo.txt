blueshogun's Todo list:


Emulation:
 - Continue sorting things out between XDKs 4432 and 4627 for 4531.  Some things from 4627
   should be moved to 4531 anyway.
 - Check for similarities in XGRAPHIC library for 4361, 4432 and 4627.
 - Continue adding support for the Xbox ADPCM codec.  Numerous open source projects support 
   it, so I guess it shouldn't be too hard.
 - Finish adding basic XACT support.
 - Ensure the Cxbx has some basic support for every XDK.  We're close, but 5028, 5120, 5455
   and 5788 need further investigation.
 - The Xbox's version of the .xsb format needs to be reversed for XACT.
 - Verify that section loading APIs can really be ignored.
 - Basic network capabilities?

More:
 - For completion's sake, we're going to have to use Direct3D 9 or OpenGL (OpenGL is better for
   emulating Xbox, trust me) to emulate all of the missing functionality of Direct3D 8.  OpenGL is
   also closer to NVIDIA's hardware.
 - An option to disable sound processing. Quantum Redshift may need this...

Game Specific:
 - Add I/CDirectSoundBuffer_Pause and I/CDirectSoundBuffer_GetStatus for 4721 (Robotech Battlecry)
 - The engine used by Taz: Wanted (4432) and Zapper (4831)  are almost completely the same.  There's
   a missing XAPI function causing the crash, so fixing one will essentially fix the other.
 - Unreal Championship requires XACT emulation.
 - Azurik: Rize of Perathia (possibly the hardest Xbox game to emulate) has some unusual situations
   going on (heap corruption, empty shaders, etc.).  We need better solutions for such scenarios.
 - DOA3 is getting close...
